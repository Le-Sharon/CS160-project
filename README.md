This is a web-based GIS application that helps users explore environmental and transportation data in their area. The application will provide an interactive basemap where users can toggle layers such as air quality, weather, and public transit. Users will also have the ability to upload their own CSV data to generate custom map layers, making the tool flexible for academic, research, and community projects.
